# Deep Learning Based Object Detection Using Convolutional Neural Netwroks

This project is small implementation of **On-Device DL-based Techniques** discussed in State Of The Art in the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09065> 

***
**Aim:** Here we adopt On-Device Deep Learning-based approach for Object Detection ( A Use Case of Smart Doorbell). This approach employs various
model reduction techniques (e.g., model compression, parameter pruning) to enable its deployment on
IoT devices, while maintaining a reasonably good object detection accuracy.The current implementation uses DenseNets, which is a family of computer vision models for TensorFlow,
designed for resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and embedded devices.
